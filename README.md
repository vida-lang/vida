### Vida ðŸŒ»
A general-purpose programming language.

Vida is a small, dynamic, interpreted programming language.

The syntax and semantics are stable and complete. The interpreter does a good job recognizing the language, but it is not efficient enough to be used in serious projects. Its performance is mosly close to the python performace in some micro-benchmarks.

The documentation still is a work in progress.
